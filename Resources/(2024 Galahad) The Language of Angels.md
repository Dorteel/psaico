What is the difference between speaking and grunting?
In a word: _resolution_. A grunt is a vocalization which contains very little information.
“Uuugh!” can mean any number of things, including, but not limited to:
- Come here
- Go away
- This is good
- This is bad
- Yes
- No

Paradoxically, in and of itself, the grunt is almost infinitely abstract. Tonality, expression, body language, gestures and the environment must all be incorporated into nonverbal communication to subtractively add meaning to the utterance.

To our pre-linguistic ancestors, meaning was diffuse. To communicate, a constellation in space and time spanning multiple information channels had to be weaved.

If you’ve ever played charades or spoken to somebody who doesn’t understand your language, you’ll know exactly what this looks like; a feeble chain of weak signals crudely strung together to pass a penny of thought from one mind to another.

Nothing can be said, only bluntly suggested.

A [simple demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMGPC4WxEpM&t=24s) of how wired photo transmission works.

The word — the technical grunt — is able to “fold up” this same information into efficient vocal hieroglyphics through a process I call _compaction_.

I didn’t want to call it that. It’s Zell’s word. It was neither pretentious nor abstruse enough for me.

“How about you just trust me and look up the etymology?“ she said.

Grudgingly, I did.

Compaction, curiously, means to make a covenant. _Com-_ means “with” (companion, community) and _pact_ of course, still means “bargain” or “agreement.”

Compaction also happens psychically. In this case, personality complexifies over time by modelling the social environment. Individuals form internal representations of their community in order to navigate it. These autonomous representations are then gradually integrated into a more sophisticated conscious personality.

It also happens technologically. The city, for instance — [the original “central processing unit”](https://substack.com/home/post/p-142750981) — was compacted into the circuit board. The same process causes computers to get smaller and more powerful over time, but it began before the computer even existed.

These are multiple facets of a unified techno-social psycholinguistic process which drives the evolution of human culture and civilization.

The gyrification of the human brain

Compaction is a kind of distillation by gyrification. Folding, coiling and winding, shrinking the distances between nodes. The internet for instance networks all the computers in the world. The processes facilitated by this network then drive the compaction of the network itself.

Since shrinking the distances between servers would defeat the internet’s purpose, compaction occurs by increasing bitrates — shrinking time instead of space. From the perspective of relativity, the same thing is being shrunk in either case.

This same thing happens technologically, socially and neurologically — even biologically across a long enough period.

A single word is equivalent to a “sentence” of grunts and gestures. You can’t grunt “photosynthesis.” You would have to find some way to communicate “plant,” then “sun” and then “food,” at the bare minimum.

In morse code, likewise, each letter is its own little “sentence.” Digital information, which at the most basic level consists of ones and zeros, works the same way.

The bit is to the byte as the grunt to the word.

The word sentence is related to the word sentient, coming from the root _sentio_ which means “to sense” and so is connected to the idea of “making sense” (literally: creating perceptions).

Linguistic representational space is more compacted than pre-verbal representational space. The information channel is wider.

A thought that spans 25 “frames” with 21602 units of representational space requires 225 “frames” with 7202 units of representational space.

When representational space expands, representational time contracts. Hence the title of the post that first described constellation: _[Here Time Becomes Space](https://galahaderidanus.substack.com/p/here-time-becomes-space)._

The process of compaction is necessarily hastening the approach of the eschaton, as it accelerates all other teleological processes.

Egyptian Ox Head Hieroglyph. Phoenician Alef. Greek Alpha.

Compaction is what causes things to become images, images to become logograms and logograms to become letters. The Egyptian hieroglyph of an ox’s head became the Hebrew aleph, hence its similarity to the word ‘elef which begins with an aleph and means ox. The Phoenician variant, alef, becomes the Greek alpha.

The Greek omega descends from the Phoenician ayin, which means “eye” and is shaped like an oval. It is thought to descend from the Egyptian hieroglyph of an eye.

Logo of Christopher Nolan’s production company Syncopy features a maze. It took me a year to crack the meaning of this.

Syncopation is a well-known form of compaction. It is the omission or contraction of sounds and syllables in a word. It tends to occur in casual speech and poetry. “Going to” becomes “gonna.” “Do not” becomes “don’t.” “I am” becomes “I’m.”

Biblical stories are highly compacted as well. In the little Bible I have on hand, the gospel of Matthew, a full telling of the life of Jesus is just a little under 33 pages.

Compaction is what the contemporary magical practice of sigilization is grunting and gesturing at. My retracing of etymological lineages is based on the same principle.

Crude [Thanatoid](https://galahaderidanus.substack.com/p/the-deathly-ones) sorcery.

Etymologically, to imply means to enfold. Compaction requires that information be “enfolded” in such a way that it is simplified while the original meaning remains implicitly intact. In practice this isn’t easy. Things can’t be folded up arbitrarily because you must know how to unfold (explicate) them when necessary.

Here is my variant of the [mnemonic major system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system):

- 0 = S, Z
    
- 1 = T, D
    
- 2 = N
    
- 3 = M
    
- 4 = R
    
- 5 = F, V
    
- 6 = K, G
    
- 7 = L
    
- 8 = J, Ch, Sh
    
- 9 = P, B
    

The system links consonant sounds (not the letters, but the sounds) to integers. Vowels are unassigned and can be used anywhere.

The system is not arbitrary. 5 is F and V because “**f**i**v**e” contains both. 7 is L because you can rotate a 7 into an L. 6 is K because it reminds me of time (Chronos).

There’s nothing special about it. I designed it to work for me. I use it to remember phone numbers, addresses, and any number string I have to.

Suppose I need to remember 7 635 414.

This number would be: L KMF RDR

Which I can transliterate as “I **L**i**K**e **M**y **F**ou**R** **D**oo**R.**“ This is extra memorable because I do like my four door. To fold it up even further, I can just picture my car. This reminds me of the phrase and the phrase encodes the number.

Such bindings are compacted with use. This is why reading eventually becomes involuntary. It’s why you can ride a bike, drive a car and type on a keyboard as if these technologies were a part of you — because you’ve made a pact with them.

You may notice that this type of mnemonic system is basically just Hebrew gematria in reverse, and I think that’s not a coincidence.

Gematria may or may not be the secret cosmic cipher its proponents claim it to be. Either way, it is invaluable as a mnemonic and recombinant technology.

A list of errands for the day

Recently, I needed to go to the bank, pick up a soldered chain and buy some ground beef and fruit. To compact this, I pictured a bull wearing a gold chain in a vineyard.

Bulls (beef), gold (chain) and viticulture (fruit) are all related to wealth (the bank).

These are idiosyncratic and purely utilitarian constructs which I rarely use more than once, but it is not much different from the way words are formed. First, a phrase or sentence is converted into a kind of logogram: com-pactum (“covenant with”) which, through repeated use, is refined until its original meaning is only implied.

The derived English word compact originally referred to a formal agreement, similar to a contract. It is unsurprising then, that compaction and contraction are synonyms.

ENIAC (left) a military supercomputer from 1945 weighed 30 tons and took up 1 800² feet. It could perform approximately 2 890 floating point operations per second. The Mac Studio equipped with two M2 Max SoC units from 2023 (right) weighs 8 pounds, is around 8² inches and can perform 31.6 trillion operations per second. It is ~11 billion times more powerful than ENIAC. An equivalent ENIAC system would have to be 2.6 times the size of Texas.

Psycholinguistic compaction first expands representational space. Expanded representational space accelerates technical innovation. Technical innovation complicates (“folds together”) the social environment. The more complex (“weaved/braided”) environment then drives further psycholinguistic compaction, closing the circuit.

In this way, the psycholinguistic and technosocial aspects of compaction can be seen to be [inextricably and symbiotically linked](https://cityofplay.substack.com/p/computing-providence). In light of this analogy, the idea of “the singularity” takes on uncanny literality.

Even the name “Leviathan” derives from the word lavah which means to “twist” or “coil” as well as to “join together.”

In my estimation, psycholinguistic and technosocial compaction can be seen as the conscious and unconscious sides of one phenomenon.

What is the difference between speaking and grunting?

In a sense, there isn’t one, especially if you only know how to grunt. But in another sense, especially if you know how to speak, they are not the same at all.
