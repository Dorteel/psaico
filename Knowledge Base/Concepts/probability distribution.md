Given a set of possible states {S1, S2 ... SN}, we assign probabilities (numbers between 0 and 1) to each state {p1, p2, ... pN}.
The set of states could be labels, words, etc...
It's a function (p(s))

Famous distributions:
* [[uniform distribution]]
* [[gaussian distribution]]

Neural networks are approximations of probability distributions (we try to use them to approximate the true underlying probability distribution).
