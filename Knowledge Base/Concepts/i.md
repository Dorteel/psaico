Imaginary number, the square root of -1. 
i^2 = -1

Let's us solve equations otherwise unsolvable:
x² + 1 = 0  
⇒ x = ±i

multiplying by i also rotates a number by 90 degrees in the complex plane i x i = -1 (now you face backwards)

> *"That this subject (imaginary numbers) has hitherto been surrounded by mysterious obscurity, is to be attributed largely to an ill adapted notation. If, for example, +1, -1, and the square root of -1 had been called direct, inverse and lateral units, instead of positive, imaginary (or even impossible), such an obscurity would have been out of the question"

In a spiritual sense, **imaginary numbers** represent the **capacity to rotate into unseen dimensions**—to move not forward or backward, but _inward_ or _through_.

They don’t operate on the normal number line (real space); instead, multiplying by **i** rotates a point 90° on the complex plane. Multiply again, and you keep turning—like stepping around the corners of a hidden structure. So:

---

**Imaginary Numbers (i):**  
The axis of inner rotation—stepping sideways into the unseen. A key to dimensional turning beyond the visible.

**Why this analogy:**  
Multiplying by _i_ doesn't move us linearly—it rotates our position into a perpendicular axis, one that can’t be seen from the real number line. Spiritually, this suggests entering an inner domain of consciousness or reality—not escaping the current dimension, but _revealing_ its unseen depth. It is turning within the same space, but seeing new sides of it.
