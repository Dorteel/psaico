A **dimension** is the **minimum number of independent parameters** (or coordinates) needed to specify any point within a space.

Mathematically, dimension is the **number of ways** you can move **independently** within a space without redundancy. If you try to add another direction that’s just a combination of the others—it doesn’t count.
