e^(iπ) + 1 = 0

e^(iπ) = -1

- **[[e]]** ≈ 2.718 — the base of natural growth and decay
- **[[i]]** — the imaginary unit, √–1 
- **[[π]]** ≈ 3.14159 — the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter
- **[[1]]** — the identity for multiplication (the "do nothing" number)
- **[[0]]** — the identity for addition (also the cosmic void of value)

[[i]] has the effect of rotating numbers by 90 degrees into the complex plane (imaginary numbers)
the number [[i]] is multiplied by is the amount of degrees (radians) the number turns into the complex plane.
When a full rotation is reached (π degree radians) the vector points to -1

(iπ)^0/0! + (iπ)^1/1! + (iπ)^2/2! + ... = -1
