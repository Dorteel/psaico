**π (pi):**  
The divine ratio of cyclical unfolding. It maps linear distance to circular existence.

**Why this analogy:**  
π is the bridge between straight and curved space—between movement around and movement across. It ties the finite to the infinite through a constant that defines every circle, orbit, and wave. It _unfolds_ the hidden geometry of loops, rotations, and returns.
