**Rotation:**  
Reorienting within a fixed space while preserving distanceâ€”turning without leaving.

---

**Why this analogy:**  
Rotation is not about going somewhere new, but about revealing new perspectives within the same space. It represents transformation without displacement, like spiritual insight that shifts perception while the external remains unchanged. It's motion with rootedness.
