Euler's number ≈ 2.71828
also sometimes expressed as the function [[exp()]]
It's special because the derivative of e^x is e^x .
It grows as fast as it exists.
It's the constant that governs natural growth and decay.
ties together [[euler's identity]]

Example:
e^t : is position
d/dt e^t : velocity

The velocity is the same as the position: at time zero e^0 you are at 1.
Then as t increases, the further you are from 0 the faster you move.
The derivative of e^-x is e^-x or -e^x, meaning the velocity decreases  (slows down) as it approaches 0.

[[taylor series]]:
e^x= x^0+x^1+x^2/2+x^3/6+...+x^n/n!+...

**Euler's number (_e_):**  
The growth constant of becoming—how systems unfold when they grow by feeding on themselves.

**Why this analogy:**  
_e_ governs continuous, compounding growth—like interest, populations, decay, and even consciousness. It models how something expands when every part of it contributes to more expansion. It's the archetype of self-reinforcing transformation—**growth from within**, without external pacing.
