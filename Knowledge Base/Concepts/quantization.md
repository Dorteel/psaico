Reducing a model’s precision by mapping continuous (32-bit floating point) values to discrete levels (8-bit integers).

**CHATGPT**:
- **FP32 (float32):**  
    Full precision. Fancy, expensive, overkill unless you’re hugging the model in a datacenter.  
    → _“I am a sovereign weight with glorious decimal subtlety.”_
    
- **FP16 / BF16:**  
    Half precision. Still floating-point, but cheaper. FP16 is common on GPUs; BF16 is a weird brainchild of Google that sacrifices less range.  
    → _“I still have nuance, but I shop at discount stores.”_
    
- **INT8 (8-bit integers):**  
    Fixed-point numbers. Much smaller. Model might forget a few things, like nuance or manners, but it’s still functional.  
    → _“I remember most stuff, but don’t ask me to explain poetry.”_
    
- **INT4:**  
    Brutal. Accuracy often takes a hit. But if it still works, you just saved a ton of memory.  
    → _“I’m cheap and fast. Don’t ask too many questions.”_
    
- **INT2 / Binary / Ternary:**  
    Welcome to the void. This is research territory. Model now thinks in grunts.  
    → _“Me weight. Me predict. Sometimes.”_
